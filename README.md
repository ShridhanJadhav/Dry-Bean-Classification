# Dry Bean Classification using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on the classification of different types of dry beans using machine learning techniques. The objective is to develop a robust and accurate model that can classify dry beans based on various geometric attributes extracted from images.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and consists of geometric attributes of dry beans obtained from images. It includes features such as area, perimeter, major and minor axis length, aspect ratio, eccentricity, convex area, equivalent diameter, extent, solidity, roundness, compactness, and shape factors. Each bean in the dataset is labeled with its corresponding type or variety, making it suitable for supervised classification tasks.

## Project Structure
The project follows a systematic approach with the following stages:

1. **Data Collection and Understanding**: Exploring the dataset to understand its structure, feature distributions, and characteristics. This stage involves loading the dataset, checking basic statistics, and understanding the meaning of each feature.

2. **Data Preparation**: Preprocessing the dataset to ensure it is suitable for model training. This includes handling duplicates, missing values, and outliers, as well as performing feature scaling and encoding categorical variables if necessary.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducting in-depth analysis to gain insights into the relationships between features and the target variable. Visualization techniques such as histograms, box plots, and correlation matrices are used to explore the data and identify patterns.

4. **Model Building**: Selecting an appropriate machine learning algorithm for bean classification. In this project, the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is chosen due to its simplicity and effectiveness in classification tasks.

5. **Model Training**: Training the KNN model on the preprocessed dataset and optimizing hyperparameters using cross-validation techniques. The optimal value of K is determined to maximize model performance.

6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the trained model's performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the confusion matrix. This stage assesses the model's ability to generalize well to unseen data and make accurate predictions.


## Results
The trained KNN model achieves impressive results with high accuracy and robust generalization performance on unseen data. Detailed evaluation metrics, visualizations, and insights are provided in the project documentation.

## Future Work
- Experiment with other machine learning algorithms and ensemble methods to further improve classification performance.
- Explore advanced feature engineering techniques to extract more meaningful features from the bean images.
- Deploy the trained model as a web application or API for real-time bean classification in agricultural settings.
