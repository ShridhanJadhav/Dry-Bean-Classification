Dry Bean Classification
Dataset : Click Here
Columns Overview:
* Area: 
The area of a bean zone and the number of pixels within its boundaries.


* Perimeter:
Bean circumference is defined as the length of its border.
* MajorAxisLength:
The distance between the ends of the longest line that can be drawn from a bean.


* MinorAxisLength:
The longest line that can be drawn from the bean while standing perpendicular to the main axis.
* AspectRation:
Defines the relationship between L and l.
*  Eccentricity:
Eccentricity of the ellipse having the same moments as the region.
*  ConvexArea:
Number of pixels in the smallest convex polygon that can contain the area of a bean seed.
*  EquivDiameter:
The diameter of a circle having the same area as a bean seed area.
*  Extent:
The ratio of the pixels in the bounding box to the bean area.
*  Solidity:
Also known as convexity. The ratio of the pixels in the convex shell to those found in beans.
*  Roundness:
Calculated with the following formula: (4piA)/(P^2)
*  Compactness:
Measures the roundness of an object: Ed/L
*  Class:
Class (Seker, Barbunya, Bombay, Cali, Dermosan, Horoz and Sira)


OBJECTIVES:
* Perform the initial analysis on the dataset
* Do the data preprocessing 
* Perform end-to-end EDA
* Split the data into train, validation and test sets.
* For every algorithm of KNN, build a model
* Finally, come up with a generalized model for the classification problem.
